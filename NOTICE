Project Summary:
IX-ZeroCell is an ultra-low-power, real-world energy harvesting platform that requires **no batteries**.
It captures energy from ambient sources (kinetic, RF, thermal, tribo, piezo) and powers devices via USB or raw DC.

Hardware is designed around:
- 99-stage coil-based kinetic harvesters
- MPPT with energy prioritization
- Supercapacitor bank for safe, fast energy storage
- Modular USB-A, USB-C, and raw outputs

Firmware is modular, written in C++ for AVR-class MCUs, with a clean separation of logic and config files.
