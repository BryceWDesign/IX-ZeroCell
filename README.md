## ✅ What Is This Project?

IX-ZeroCell™ is an open-source hardware and engineering project focused on real-world ambient energy harvesting using:

- **Pulse Coil Acceleration Arrays**  
- **RF/VLF Ambient Harvesting**
- **Magnetic Induction Tube Systems (99 tubes standard)**
- **Supercapacitor Storage**  
- **Zero Batteries Required**

Designed for:

- Emergency communications  
- Sensor networks  
- Low-wattage device power  
- Off-grid educational demonstration units

---

## ✅ Why It Matters

- Eliminates reliance on chemical batteries.
- Fully modular and scalable design.
- Based entirely on real, commercially available components.
- Open-source with no proprietary restrictions.

---

## ✅ System Output (Real-World Estimations)

- **Voltage:** 12–24V DC stabilized  
- **Current:** 0.3–0.9 Amps peak (under optimal ambient conditions)  
- **Total Wattage:** Approx. 7–20 Watts depending on configuration  

> ⚠️ *Not designed for high-drain applications like motors or heavy industrial tools.*

## ✅ Build & Usage Notes

1. Review `/hardware/bom_master.md` for parts list and sourcing.
2. Follow assembly instructions in `/hardware/assembly_instructions.md`.
3. Test output using appropriate DC multimeters and oscilloscope (if available).
4. Avoid standing directly over magnetic coil systems while active for extended periods.  
   – Refer to `/docs/safety_protocols.md` for all safety notes.
