# IX-ZeroCell – Final Output Stage

**Author:** Bryce Wooster
**License:** Apache-2.0
**Purpose:** Define output interface design including USB, JST, TVS diode clamping, filtering, and safe mechanical layout

---

## 🔌 Output Types

IX-ZeroCell can provide **regulated 3.3V or 5.0V** via:

| Port         | Type     | Use Case                             |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| USB-A        | Female   | Powering microcontrollers, sensors
| USB-C        | Sink-only| Modern boards, ESP32-C3, etc.
| JST-PH 2-pin | Male     | LiPo-like connection to sensors
| Raw Header   | 0.1" pins| Debug power, direct MCU boards

> All ports draw from same boosted rail (via MT3608 or similar)
> Switchable between 3.3V and 5.0V via jumper or slide switch

## 🔋 Decoupling + Filtering

### 🔹 Output Capacitors

- 10µF ceramic (X7R) across output rail
- 100µF electrolytic or tantalum (bulk load buffer)

### 🔹 EMI Ferrite Bead

- Place before USB VBUS pin to suppress RF spikes
- Type: 120Ω @ 100MHz (e.g. Murata BLM18 series)

### 🔹 Zener Clamping (Optional)

- Add 5.6V or 3.9V Zener from VOUT to GND
- Acts as crowbar against voltage overshoot if boost misfires

---

## ⚡ TVS Protection

### Recommended: **Unidirectional TVS diode**

- **3.3V rail** → SMAJ5.0A
- **5.0V rail** → SMAJ6.5A
- Place across VOUT to GND, as close to ports as possible

```txt
VOUT ——[TVS]—— GND
```

> Protects attached devices from ESD, inductive spikes, and MT3608 glitches.

---

## 🔄 Optional Output Switch

Use a **SPDT slide switch** or **P-MOSFET controlled by MCU** to toggle output rail on/off.

---

## 🧱 Mechanical Notes

- Mount all output ports on **same edge** of PCB or perfboard
- Include silk screen for:
  - Voltage level
  - Polarity arrows
  - Port labels (e.g. USB-A OUT, JST 5V, RAW 3.3V)

## ✅ Summary

- USB-A, USB-C (sink-only), JST, and RAW headers supported
- Every output rail is TVS-protected
- Boost converter feeds all ports simultaneously
- EMI filtering and decoupling standard
- Safe for real-world connection to dev boards, sensors, or logging systems
