# IX-ZeroCell – Burst Discharge Trigger Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster
**License:** Apache-2.0
**Purpose:** Safely release stored energy from supercapacitor bank in a high-current pulse triggered by logic or motion events

---

## ⚡ Overview

This module allows a **controlled burst of electrical energy** to be discharged from IX-ZeroCell's supercap array.

Ideal for:

- Inductive kick (e.g., spark gap ignition)
- Coil launchers / pulsed electromagnets
- Quick motor startups
- Instant flash charges
- Voltage step cascades

## 🧱 Core Components

| Component             | Notes                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Supercap Bank          | 2.7V or 5.5V ultra or hybrid caps, 10–50F total
| Gate Device            | SCR (e.g., 2N6509), IGBT (e.g., IRG4PC40), or Power MOSFET
| Trigger Logic          | Motion trigger, MCU pin, or manual button
| Flyback Diode          | 1N5408 / UF5408 for inductive loads
| Shunt Resistor (opt.)  | Optional for current monitoring
| Load (resistive/inductive)| Ignitor, motor coil, pulse bridge, etc.

## 🧮 Calculated Output

Assume:
- 15F cap bank
- Charged to 5.5V
- Dumped into 0.1Ω load via SCR

**Discharge Energy (Joules):**

```
E = ½ × C × V²
E = 0.5 × 15F × (5.5)² ≈ 113.4 joules
```

This will be released in milliseconds — powerful enough for high-voltage sparks, inrush motor kicks, or solenoid throws.

- SCR gate is pulsed by logic HIGH
- Use opto-isolator if triggering from micro
- Add small resistor (~100Ω) in gate leg

---

## 🔒 Safety Tips

- Always limit pulse width unless your load is rated
- Use heat sinks on SCR/IGBT
- Never short cap bank directly
- Add mechanical cutoff switch for testing
- Place fast-blow fuse on cap bank output line
