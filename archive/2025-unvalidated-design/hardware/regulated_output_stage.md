## 📈 Output Performance

| Cap Charge (%) | Vcap     | Boost Output | Notes                          |
|----------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| ~15%           | ~0.9V    | ~2.8V        | May fail to reach regulation
| ~40%           | ~2.2V    | 3.3V stable  | Regulated 3.3V begins
| ~60%+          | ~3.5V+   | 5.0V (USB)   | USB-level voltage enabled

---

## 🔋 USB Output Considerations

- Output current is **limited by cap bank + boost IC rating**
- Can charge low-draw items: BLE devices, earbuds, trickle-charging phones
- Should not exceed ~300mA
- Add inline polyfuse (500mA PTC) for protection

---

## 🔧 PCB Guidelines

- Keep feedback lines short
- Shield sensitive analog traces from inductor EMI
- Separate high-current input/output planes
- Use copper pour for ground under boost IC
- Ensure thermal relief if using high-draw mode (>200mA)

## 🔄 Real-World Use Examples

| Scenario                    | Device Powered       | Duration     |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| BLE Temp Sensor             | 3.3V @ 50mA avg      | 3–6 hrs
| Arduino Nano (low power)    | 3.3V @ 70mA          | 1–2 hrs
| ESP32 deep sleep cycles     | 3.3V burst @ 150mA   | 50–120 wake cycles
