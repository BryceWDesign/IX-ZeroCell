# IX-ZeroCell™ Safety Guidelines  
**Project Author: Bryce Wooster**

---

## General Safety Notice

IX-ZeroCell™ operates with electromagnetic fields, high-speed magnetic induction, and multi-source ambient energy harvesting. Proper handling and safety precautions must be followed at all times. Failure to comply may result in personal injury, equipment damage, or invalid results.

---

## Health and Exposure Considerations

- **Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)**: While IX-ZeroCell’s fields are contained within shielded enclosures, prolonged exposure closer than 0.5 meters is not recommended.
- **RF Emissions**: Passive RF harvesting antennas may broadcast minor EMF leakage. Stay clear of the unit when operating at full load.
- **Physical Movement**: Units larger than 36-cell assemblies contain moving parts such as weighted oscillators. Keep clear while active.

## Operational Safety Procedures

- **Do Not Open While Active**: Power-down procedure must be followed before removing any enclosure or cover.
- **Verify Grounding**: Ensure all grounding straps are securely attached before activation.
- **Environmental Conditions**: Operate in dry, dust-free environments between 10°C–35°C.
- **Inspection Protocol**: Perform a full hardware inspection once every 100 active hours.

---

## Build and Testing Precautions

- **No Batteries**: IX-ZeroCell™ is designed as a battery-free system. Never attempt to attach lithium-ion or similar storage devices unless explicitly indicated in future updates.
- **Reverse Polarity Risk**: Double-check coil and magnet orientation during build and assembly to prevent reverse induction surges.
- **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Use insulated gloves, safety glasses, and EMF-shielded clothing when assembling multi-unit arrays.

## Disposal and Recycling

- **Non-Toxic Materials**: IX-ZeroCell™ components are mostly recyclable aluminum, copper, and neodymium magnets.
- **Magnets**: Handle spent magnets carefully; they can retain residual magnetism and attract metal fragments.
- **Compliance**: Follow local regulations for recycling electronics and rare earth metals.

---

## Emergency Procedures

- **Shutdown Protocol**: In event of malfunction, press the designated EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON and cut all power lines immediately.
- **First Aid**: Treat exposure to high heat, electrical burns, or EMF overexposure per standard first aid protocols. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist.
