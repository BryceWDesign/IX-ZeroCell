## ✅ What Is IX-ZeroCell?

IX-ZeroCell is an open-source real-world hardware project designed to:

- Harvest ambient energy from **RF, static charge, vibration, and magnetic fields**
- Convert ambient energy into usable DC output without **traditional batteries**
- Utilize **multi-stage coil systems + capacitor pulse arrays** for energy acceleration
- Operate with no external power supply beyond ambient input, in compliance with real-world physics

---

## ✅ Key Design Principles

- **No Batteries Required:** Self-sustaining system using recycled energy principles.
- **Modular Construction:** Designed using scalable modules (99 tubes baseline configuration).
- **Real-World Hardware:** No fictional elements. All components commercially available.
- **Open Licensing:** Licensed under Apache-2.0 for free use, modification, and distribution.

---

## ✅ Primary Components

- **Pulse Coil Accelerators** (Based on magnetically-triggered pulse systems)
- **Ambient RF/VLF Harvester Arrays**
- **Multi-Tube Magnetic-Induction Array** (99 tubes standard configuration)
- **Supercapacitor Storage & Discharge Circuits**
- **Grounding & Shielding Modules**
- **Safety Systems** (E-Stop, capacitor discharge tools, operator PPE requirements)

---

## ✅ Realistic Output Range

- **Microcontroller Boards:** Continuous operation
- **Low-Wattage Lighting Systems:** (LED strips, small lamps)
- **Sensor Arrays**
- **Portable Communications Devices (limited uptime)**  
- **NOT Suitable For:** High-drain motors, e-bikes, large tools

Typical output at 99-tube scale:
- **Voltage:** 12–24V DC (stabilized via supercap circuit)
- **Current:** 0.3–0.9 Amps peak under ideal conditions

---

## ✅ Size/Physical Footprint

- **99-Tube Array Example:**  
  Approx. 5 feet long × 2 feet wide × 2 feet tall  
  Comparable to:  
  - Small refrigerator  
  - Large office printer  

---

## ✅ Intended Use Cases

- **Off-Grid Sensor Networks**
- **Emergency Communication Systems**
- **Energy Research Prototyping**
- **Educational Demonstration Units**
- **Amateur Radio Power Backup**
