## âœ… Power Applications (Realistic)

- 24/7 BLE beacon or wireless sensor nodes  
- LED strips, small logic circuits, Arduino, ESP32  
- 5V USB device charging (slow trickle, not burst)  
- Low-powered shortwave/ham receiver  
- Grid-free field deployment sensors  
- Educational demonstration kits

## ðŸ§  Final Notes

This BOM assumes ambient EM noise floor and coil motion is harvested passively, not through continuous mechanical actuation. Output is suitable for **low and ultra-low power systems**. Scaling beyond this requires additional stages or kinetic input (manual crank, etc).

If you're looking to pair this with more active magnetic piston drivers or Tesla-style resonance harvesting: start a fork and build v2.
