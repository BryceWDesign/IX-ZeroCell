# IX-ZeroCell â€“ Final Output Stage

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Define output interface design including USB, JST, TVS diode clamping, filtering, and safe mechanical layout

---

## ðŸ”Œ Output Types

IX-ZeroCell can provide **regulated 3.3V or 5.0V** via:

| Port         | Type     | Use Case                             |
|--------------|----------|--------------------------------------|
| USB-A        | Female   | Powering microcontrollers, sensors  
| USB-C        | Sink-only| Modern boards, ESP32-C3, etc.  
| JST-PH 2-pin | Male     | LiPo-like connection to sensors  
| Raw Header   | 0.1" pins| Debug power, direct MCU boards  

> All ports draw from same boosted rail (via MT3608 or similar)  
> Switchable between 3.3V and 5.0V via jumper or slide switch

## ðŸ”‹ Decoupling + Filtering

### ðŸ”¹ Output Capacitors

- 10ÂµF ceramic (X7R) across output rail  
- 100ÂµF electrolytic or tantalum (bulk load buffer)

### ðŸ”¹ EMI Ferrite Bead

- Place before USB VBUS pin to suppress RF spikes  
- Type: 120Î© @ 100MHz (e.g. Murata BLM18 series)

### ðŸ”¹ Zener Clamping (Optional)

- Add 5.6V or 3.9V Zener from VOUT to GND  
- Acts as crowbar against voltage overshoot if boost misfires

---

## âš¡ TVS Protection

### Recommended: **Unidirectional TVS diode**

- **3.3V rail** â†’ SMAJ5.0A  
- **5.0V rail** â†’ SMAJ6.5A  
- Place across VOUT to GND, as close to ports as possible

```txt
VOUT â€”â€”[TVS]â€”â€” GND
```

> Protects attached devices from ESD, inductive spikes, and MT3608 glitches.

---

## ðŸ”„ Optional Output Switch

Use a **SPDT slide switch** or **P-MOSFET controlled by MCU** to toggle output rail on/off.

---

## ðŸ§± Mechanical Notes

- Mount all output ports on **same edge** of PCB or perfboard  
- Include silk screen for:
  - Voltage level
  - Polarity arrows
  - Port labels (e.g. USB-A OUT, JST 5V, RAW 3.3V)

## âœ… Summary

- USB-A, USB-C (sink-only), JST, and RAW headers supported  
- Every output rail is TVS-protected  
- Boost converter feeds all ports simultaneously  
- EMI filtering and decoupling standard  
- Safe for real-world connection to dev boards, sensors, or logging systems
