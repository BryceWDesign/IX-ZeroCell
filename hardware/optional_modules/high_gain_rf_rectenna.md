# IX-ZeroCell – High-Gain Directional RF Rectenna Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Add-on directional antenna with rectifier for improved RF harvesting in IX-ZeroCell system

---

## 📡 Module Purpose

This module captures **ambient RF energy** more efficiently by using:

- Directional gain (up to 8–12dBi)  
- Tuned antenna elements (2.4GHz or 915MHz)  
- High-efficiency Schottky rectification

It connects to the IX-ZeroCell **combiner bus**, enhancing power intake from RF-heavy zones.

## ⚡ Typical Output (Real-World, Indoor)

| Environment         | Power Density | Harvested (Est.) |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Office Wi-Fi area   | ~0.1–1 µW/cm² | ~10–50 µW        |
| Server room         | ~1–10 µW/cm²  | ~100–500 µW      |
| Rooftop RF dense    | ~20 µW/cm²+   | ~1–2 mW          |

⚠️ Output is *continuous but low current*. Ideal for trickle-charging caps.

## 🔧 Layout Tips

- Keep rectifier close to antenna port  
- Use low-loss traces or coax  
- Match impedance (~50Ω) at RF input  
- Isolate RF from boost inductor zones  
- Antenna mounting should face strongest RF source
