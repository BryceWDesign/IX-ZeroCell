## 🌞 Module Overview

This module provides an optional **solar energy input**, designed for:

- Indoor trickle charging (office light)  
- Outdoor partial exposure (sunlight or cloudy)  
- Boosting energy availability during daylight

Connects directly to the **IX-ZeroCell input combiner**, with diode isolation.

## ⚡ Performance Snapshot

| Light Source     | Power Delivered | Usable?      |
|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Office Lighting  | ~1mW             | Slow trickle  
| Window Sunlight  | ~50–100mW        | Usable charging  
| Outdoor (Cloudy) | ~150mW           | Full assist  
| Outdoor (Direct) | >300mW           | Rapid input  

**Note:** Max input current must match cap ESR and diode rating (≤200mA typical)

## 📐 Mechanical Tips

- Mount panel externally or on PCB lid  
- Route via 2-pin JST header or flex cable  
- Tilt panel at ~30° if outdoor-mounted  
- Keep panel out of shade; ambient matters

## ✅ Summary

- Passive solar harvesting (no MPPT needed)  
- Feeds directly into IX-ZeroCell’s DC bus  
- Diode-isolated, surge-tolerant  
- Enables daylight-autonomous operation  
- No batteries, no boost from panel — just raw ambient input
