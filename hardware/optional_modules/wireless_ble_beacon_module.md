# IX-ZeroCell â€“ Optional BLE Beacon Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Wireless Bluetooth LE module powered by IX-ZeroCell for sensor or presence broadcast

---

## ðŸ“¡ Module Overview

BLE beacon modules provide wireless output from harvested energy. Beaconing allows:

- âœ… Passive environmental monitoring  
- âœ… Device presence or ID broadcast  
- âœ… Indoor positioning (via trilateration)  
- âœ… Security authentication / logging  

This module is powered directly by the **regulated 3.3V output** from the IX-ZeroCell boost stage.

## ðŸ”Œ Hardware Components

| Component            | Value / Part #             | Notes                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| BLE SoC Module       | nRF52811 or nRF51822       | Ultra-low-power, proven BLE stack  
| Antenna              | PCB trace or ceramic chip  | 2.4GHz BLE  
| Cap Decoupling       | 1ÂµF + 100nF @ VCC           | Per Nordic specs  
| Pullups              | 10kÎ© on SWD, RESET          | Debug + boot stability  
| Oscillator (optional)| 32kHz XTAL or RC           | For sleep timing accuracy

## âš¡ Power Considerations

| Mode          | Current | Duration     | Notes                          |
|---------------|---------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| Sleep (deep)  | ~0.5ÂµA  | Indefinite   | Cap leakage dominates  
| Beacon Pulse  | ~4â€“6mA  | ~2ms burst   | Once per interval  
| Avg. Current  | < 100ÂµA | At 10s interval | Fully sustainable via IX-ZeroCell

## ðŸ”§ Firmware Behavior

Default firmware operates as:

1. Sleep deep  
2. Wake every X seconds  
3. Transmit BLE advertisement (Eddystone or iBeacon format)  
4. Sleep again

---

## ðŸ“¡ BLE Packet Contents

- Unique device ID or sensor hash  
- Timestamp (if RTC available)  
- Battery-less flag (advertises `CellZero`)  
- Optional sensor data (e.g. temperature)

## ðŸ§  Real-World Use Case Examples

| Use Case               | Description                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Security Beacon        | Broadcast UUID for presence logging  
| Environment Sensor     | Transmit temp/humidity every 30s  
| Lost Asset Marker      | Broadcast device ID every 10s  
| Retail Analytics       | Passive customer motion mapping  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Board Layout Hints

- Ground pour under BLE module  
- Isolate RF from boost inductor  
- Keep antenna edge-clear (min 5mm)  
- Bypass caps <2mm from VCC pin

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Snapshot

| Cap Charge Level | Functionality    | Notes                         |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0.8â€“1.5V         | Sleep only       | Wonâ€™t beacon  
| 1.8â€“2.2V         | Wake + beacon 1x | 10â€“15s interval  
| >2.8V            | Full periodic TX | 3â€“5s interval possible

## âœ… Summary

- Passive BLE presence module  
- Draws microamps at sleep, ~6mA at transmit  
- Fully powered from IX-ZeroCellâ€™s 3.3V regulated output  
- Broadcasts using standard BLE (iOS/Android/PC readable)  
- Firmware-free options exist (preloaded beacon firmware on Nordic modules)
