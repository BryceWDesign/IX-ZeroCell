# IX-ZeroCell – Audio Alert Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Provide audible system alerts such as low-cap-bank voltage, charging complete, or fault state.

## 🔊 Why This Module Exists

- Users may not always be watching voltage displays.  
- Simple audible alerts increase safety and usability.  
- Minimal power draw using piezo buzzers or low-watt speakers.

## 🧱 Core Components

| Component           | Recommended Part      | Notes                           |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Piezo Buzzer       | Passive or Active    | 3–5V compatible  
| Audio Amplifier IC | PAM8403 / LM386      | Optional for louder output  
| Microcontroller    | ESP32 / Arduino Nano | Triggers sound via GPIO  
| Capacitor          | 100µF–470µF          | For filtering if needed

## 🔌 Basic Wiring Example

```txt
IX-ZeroCell 5V --> VCC (Buzzer)  
IX-ZeroCell GND --> GND (Buzzer + MCU)  
MCU GPIO Pin --> Buzzer Control (for PWM or On/Off)  
```

For amplified audio:  
MCU Audio Out --> PAM8403 Amp --> Small Speaker

## 🖥️ Control Logic Snippet

```c
#define BUZZER_PIN 9

void setup() {
  pinMode(BUZZER_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Low voltage alert
  if (voltage < 4.8) {
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, 1000); // 1 kHz tone
    delay(500);
    noTone(BUZZER_PIN);
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

- Compatible with Arduino Nano or ESP32.  
- Adjust frequency and duration per alert type.

## 🛠️ Configuration Notes

- Passive buzzers need PWM control (tone library).  
- Active buzzers can be driven directly via GPIO HIGH/LOW.  
- Amplified speakers draw more power — test with cap bank fully charged.  
- Recommended max **3–5 second alert bursts** only.  

---

## ⚠️ Safety & Practical Tips

- Keep buzzer volume within **safe hearing limits**.  
- Mount buzzer on **isolation standoffs** to avoid case vibration issues.  
- Test full system first to ensure buzzer doesn't cause cap voltage dip below MCU cutoff.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Adds audible alerts to IX-ZeroCell setups.  
- Easy to implement alongside display and motor modules.  
- Minimal power consumption if used sparingly.
