## ‚úÖ Wiring Notes

- Use shielded cables for all signal lines.  
- Power lines from control panel to main bus:  
  - **14 AWG minimum** for switch circuits.  
  - Emergency Stop circuit wired through **latching relay** setup.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Human Safety Considerations

- Control Panel must be mounted with at least **IP54** enclosure rating minimum.  
- Labels must be engraved, not stickers, for long-term readability.  
- Operator training: Only certified personnel should interact with panel.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- The Control Panel is the operator‚Äôs direct control hub for IX-ZeroCell.  
- Build quality = critical. Do not compromise on switch or indicator specs.  
- Emergency Stop must work **independently** of software controls.
