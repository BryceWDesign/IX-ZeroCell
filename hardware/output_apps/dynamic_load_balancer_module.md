# IX-ZeroCell ‚Äì Dynamic Load Balancer Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Maintain system stability by balancing variable output loads from IX-ZeroCell‚Äôs magnetic pulse arrays and capacitor banks in real time.

## üí° Why Dynamic Load Balancing?

- Passive generation systems like IX-ZeroCell can experience fluctuating output voltage and current.
- Connecting sensitive electronics (e.g., inverters, computers) requires steady power delivery.
- Capacitor dumps and coil array pulsing create large transients‚Äîmust be smoothed dynamically.

| Component             | Recommended Part             | Notes                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Microcontroller      | ESP32, STM32, or ATmega328  | For PWM and balancing control logic  
| Solid-State Relays   | Opto-Isolated SSRs          | Switching capacitor banks/load resistors  
| Shunt Resistors      | 0.01‚Äì0.1 Ohm                | Current sensing  
| Hall-Effect Sensors  | ACS712, ACS758               | Voltage + current monitoring  
| PWM Driver IC        | PCA9685 or similar           | For controlling relay array

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Input Monitoring:**  
   - Hall sensors + shunts feed real-time voltage/current data to MCU.  

2. **Balancing Logic:**  
   - MCU calculates output fluctuations.  
   - If voltage spikes, trigger capacitor dumps or load resistors.  
   - If voltage sags, reduce balancing loads dynamically.  

3. **Control Output:**  
   - PWM drivers command SSRs to switch capacitor banks or dump loads on/off at microsecond timing granularity.

## ‚úÖ MCU Code Requirements

- Real-time voltage and current monitoring (ADC readouts at 1kHz+ sampling rate).
- Load balancing algorithm: PID or simpler threshold triggers.
- Fail-safe defaults: Relays drop into neutral state if MCU resets or power loss occurs.
- Optional: Data logging over serial or Wi-Fi (ESP32 recommended for this feature).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Notes

- SSRs must be rated above maximum possible system voltage and expected balancing current.  
- Capacitor bank resistors need active cooling (heatsinks or fan-cooled enclosure).  
- Place sensors as close to output terminals as practical for accurate readings.

---

## üîß Real-World Limitations

- Not a replacement for full battery management system (BMS) in lithium systems.  
- Best for stabilizing purely capacitor or coil-based power generation units like IX-ZeroCell.  
- Adds measurable complexity‚Äîrequires solid firmware debugging and testing.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Keeps IX-ZeroCell output steady for sensitive loads.  
- Combines sensors, microcontrollers, PWM-controlled SSRs, and capacitor banks.  
- Mandatory for any multi-load deployment scenario.
