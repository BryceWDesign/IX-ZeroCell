## üí° Why This Module Exists

- Not everything should rely on automated cutoff logic.  
- Manual user-accessible kill switches are standard in real-world power systems.  
- Adds an extra layer of safety, particularly during testing or troubleshooting.

## üß± Core Components

| Component             | Recommended Part              | Notes                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Industrial Kill Switch | E-Stop Button / Mushroom Switch | DPDT or higher-rated mechanical switch  
| High-Amp Toggle Switch | 20A‚Äì60A Switch              | For smaller sub-systems  
| Enclosure            | Industrial Plastic or Metal  | Ensures tamper-proof and secure mounting

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Total System Cutoff (Main Line)

- **Kill Switch wired in series** with IX-ZeroCell's main power bus.
- Switch rating must exceed max possible system current (design for 2x expected load minimum).

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sub-System Isolation

- Separate manual cutoffs per:
  - Charging input  
  - Primary output  
  - Coil array control circuit  
- Helps isolate only specific sections while leaving others active if needed.

For sub-system isolation:

```

[ Primary Output ] --- [ Kill Switch 2 ]
[ Control System ] --- [ Kill Switch 3 ]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Build Notes

- Always mount switches in an easily accessible location.  
- Use proper wire gauge and terminal lugs rated for your system voltage and amperage.  
- Test switch action manually before powering up the main system.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-World Considerations

- Mushroom switches preferred for emergency use‚Äîhigh visibility, large surface area.  
- IP65-rated enclosures recommended for outdoor builds or high-dust environments.  
- Label all switches clearly to avoid confusion during operation.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Simple but essential safety feature.  
- No software dependency‚Äîpurely hardware.  
- Should always be present on real-world IX-ZeroCell builds.
