## üí° Why EMF Shielding?

- Rapid magnetic pulses induce stray electromagnetic fields.  
- Interference with sensitive electronics: radios, Wi-Fi, microcontrollers.  
- Possible long-term exposure health concerns if unshielded at high pulse rates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Full System Enclosure

- Build a metal case lined with Mu-Metal and grounded copper mesh.  
- Entry points (power cables, sensor wires) pass through filtered connectors.  
- Note: Heavier, higher cost, best for lab setups.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Localized Shielding

- Wrap coil arrays individually in Mu-Metal or Ferrite sheets.  
- Capacitor banks enclosed in copper mesh boxes.  
- Air gaps maintained for thermal dissipation‚Äîcombine with ventilation system.

## ‚úÖ Grounding Best Practices

- All shielding materials must connect to common ground plane.  
- Avoid floating conductive elements that can act as unintended antennas.  
- Use star-grounding layout to avoid ground loops.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Notes

- Mu-Metal loses effectiveness if bent sharply‚Äîhandle carefully during install.  
- Combine shielding with proper wire routing: keep high-voltage lines away from signal wires.  
- Do not rely on shielding alone for safety‚Äîcombine with load balancers and thermal modules.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- EMF shielding is essential for safe and interference-free IX-ZeroCell operation.  
- Use Mu-Metal, copper mesh, ferrite tiles, and grounded enclosures.  
- Follow strict grounding and installation protocols for best results.
