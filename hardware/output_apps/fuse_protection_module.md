## üí° Why Fuses?

- Protects wiring and components from damage due to overload conditions.  
- Essential in pulse capacitor discharge systems where accidental shorts can cause catastrophic damage.  
- Required for compliance with electrical safety standards.

## üß± Recommended Fuse Types

| System Area            | Fuse Type          | Amperage Rating Notes                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Main Power Input      | Blade Fuse (ATO/ATC) | 10A‚Äì100A depending on coil stack count     |
| Capacitor Banks       | High-Speed Ceramic Fuse | Pulse-rated, 400V‚Äì1000V DC, 30A‚Äì200A       |
| Control Circuitry     | Glass Cartridge Fuse | 500mA‚Äì3A depending on MCU and relay draw    |
| Fan & Pump Systems    | Standard Blade Fuse | 5A‚Äì10A                                       |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Placement Guide

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Main Power Fuse:**  
- Between battery bank (if present) and pulse driver circuit.  
- Close to power source to minimize unprotected wiring length.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Capacitor Bank Fuses:**  
- Inline on each capacitor series string.  
- Fuse rating = slightly above max expected pulse current.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Control Circuit Fuses:**  
- On low-voltage rail feeding MCU, relay drivers, fan controllers.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Fan/Pump System Fuses:**  
- Inline on dedicated 12V or 24V supply rail.

## ‚úÖ Fuse Selection Notes

- **Always choose fuse voltage rating higher than system voltage.**  
- Pulse discharge fuses must be rated for DC and fast response time.  
- Replace all fuses after serious fault event even if they appear intact.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Notes

- Use dedicated fuse blocks with secure mounts.  
- Label each fuse location for serviceability.  
- Keep spare fuses on hand‚Äîbuild kits should include 2‚Äì3 spares per type.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Fuses are a non-optional safety layer in IX-ZeroCell.  
- Protects user and system hardware from overload and fault conditions.  
- Must be integrated into all hardware builds, especially capacitor-heavy modules.
