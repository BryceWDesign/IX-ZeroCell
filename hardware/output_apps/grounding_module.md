# IX-ZeroCell – Grounding and RF Shielding Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Define full RF shielding, grounding, and EMI/RFI control layout for IX-ZeroCell system.

## ✅ Why This Matters

- IX-ZeroCell operates with high-current pulses at high frequency.  
- EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) and RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) must be contained.  
- Proper grounding protects both the system and nearby electronics/humans.

## ✅ Grounding System Overview

| Element            | Specification                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Chassis Ground    | Entire frame bonded to ground rod |
| Ground Rod        | 8 ft copper-clad steel rod      |
| Wire Gauge        | 4 AWG minimum copper wire       |
| Connection Method | Mechanical clamp + soldered joint|
| Bonding Points    | Pulse coil frame, control panel, capacitor bank case, all metal surfaces |

## ✅ RF Shielding System

| Element            | Specification                            |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Enclosure Type    | Steel mesh Faraday cage + solid panels  |
| Mesh Size         | <5 mm hole diameter                     |
| Panel Material    | Steel or copper                         |
| Entry Points      | Cable entry ports with ferrite bead filtering|
| Grounding Bond    | Shield enclosure bonded to main ground rod|

## ✅ Additional EMI/RFI Mitigation

- Use **braided copper shielded cabling** wherever signal/control lines exist.  
- Apply **ferrite chokes** on power leads (input and output).  
- Maintain **minimum 2-inch separation** between high-power pulse lines and signal lines.  
- Install **EMI-rated panel-mount filters** on any AC/DC power input lines.

## ✅ Assembly Notes

1. Ensure all metal enclosures have continuous electrical continuity.  
2. Test resistance between any two chassis points: **Should not exceed 0.1 Ohm**.  
3. Inspect all ground connections monthly if deployed long-term.  
4. Install grounding strap between enclosure and ground rod—not just wire alone.

## ✅ Regulatory Considerations

- For deployment in populated areas:  
  — System must pass **FCC Part 15 Class A** emission standards minimum.  
  — Local jurisdiction grounding codes (NEC/NFPA) must be observed.  

---

## ✅ Summary

- The IX-ZeroCell is only as stable as its grounding and shielding setup.  
- Properly applied Faraday cage and chassis bonding reduce risks dramatically.  
- Real-world tested layout ensures reliable operation with minimal external impact.
