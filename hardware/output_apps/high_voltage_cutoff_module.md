## 🧱 Core Components

| Component            | Recommended Part      | Notes                            |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Voltage Comparator  | LM393 / LM339        | Compares cap bank voltage vs setpoint  
| Relay Module        | 5V or 12V Coil Relay  | Disconnects load  
| Reference Voltage   | Adjustable Zener or Potentiometer | Sets cutoff threshold  
| Pull-down Resistors | 10k–100k Ω            | For stable comparator inputs

## 🔌 Basic Wiring Example

```txt
Cap Bank + --> Voltage Divider --> Comparator V+  
Reference Voltage --> Comparator V-  

Comparator Output --> Relay Driver Circuit --> Load Switch Relay  

Cap Bank Ground --> Comparator Ground  
```

---

## 🖥️ Example Threshold Setup

- Cap bank nominal voltage: **5.0V–5.5V**  
- Cutoff voltage: **5.6V** (adjustable)

Voltage Divider Setup:

- **R1:** 10k Ω  
- **R2:** 1k Ω  

Calculates V+ input to comparator relative to cap bank voltage.  
Adjust R1/R2 values to match system size.

## 🛠️ Configuration Notes

- **Relay should default to “On”** when comparator output is LOW.  
- Once V+ exceeds V- (setpoint), comparator output switches, cutting relay.  
- Add **hysteresis resistor** if needed to prevent rapid toggling near threshold.

---

## ⚠️ Safety Considerations

- Relays must handle IX-ZeroCell’s maximum output current.  
- Comparator reference voltage must be stable and reliable.  
- Mount cutoff module with adequate separation from high-frequency switching components to avoid interference.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Protects IX-ZeroCell system and connected equipment from overvoltage.  
- Hardware-based — no software dependency required.  
- Simple to implement using LM393 or similar ICs.
