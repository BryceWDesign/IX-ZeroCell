# IX-ZeroCell ‚Äì Manual Override Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Provide a hardware-based manual control layer for emergency shutoff, bypassing digital systems.

## üí° Why Manual Override?

- Digital control systems can fail: firmware errors, sensor faults, UI lockups.  
- Safety requires a guaranteed human-controlled fallback.  
- Also simplifies field testing and troubleshooting.

## üß± Core Components

| Component               | Spec / Notes                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Emergency Stop Button  | 22mm Momentary Push-Lock (Industrial Standard) |
| High-Amp Mechanical Switch | DC-rated knife switch or rotary breaker  |
| Manual Pulse Trigger   | Keyed toggle switch + momentary pushbutton  |
| Status Indicator LEDs  | 12V/24V DC-rated, Red = Stop, Green = Active |
| Optional Potentiometer | Manual power level adjust override          |

## ‚úÖ Wiring Best Practices

- Emergency Stop Button must directly cut power to pulse discharge systems, not rely on MCU or relay control.  
- Use keyed switches to prevent unauthorized manual triggering.  
- Label all switches clearly (English text + symbol graphics if possible).  

---

## ‚úÖ Enclosure Notes

- Mount manual override system in an external, clearly visible control box.  
- Use industrial control panels or DIY metal enclosures with weather sealing for field units.  
- Keep override controls separate from sensitive electronics to avoid accidental damage during emergencies.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Notes

- Do not rely exclusively on manual override for regular use‚Äîit‚Äôs a fallback, not primary control.  
- Test manual systems regularly under controlled conditions.  
- Manual pulse triggering must include debounce logic if using digital systems in parallel (covered in software section).

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Manual Override Module = critical safety layer.  
- Includes emergency stop, manual pulse fire, and power level adjustment.  
- Protects both operator and IX-ZeroCell hardware from unplanned behavior.
