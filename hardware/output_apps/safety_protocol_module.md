# IX-ZeroCell – Safety Protocol and Operator Requirements

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Define mandatory safety protocols for handling, operating, and maintaining IX-ZeroCell devices.

---

## ✅ Overview

IX-ZeroCell systems operate with:

- High-voltage capacitors
- Rapid magnetic pulse generators
- Ambient energy harvesting modules

Failure to follow strict safety protocols may result in serious injury, equipment damage, or legal violations.

## ✅ System Pre-Operation Checklist

1. **Grounding Confirmed**  
   - Measure continuity to ground rod  
   - Verify resistance < 0.1 Ohm between all chassis points

2. **Capacitor Bank Inspection**  
   - Confirm voltage is zero before handling  
   - Check all insulation and terminals  

3. **Coil and Pulse System Check**  
   - Verify mechanical integrity of coil windings  
   - Ensure pulse switching system is properly isolated  

4. **Ambient Harvester Check**  
   - Ensure all RF antenna elements are securely mounted  
   - Verify shielding system integrity

## ✅ Active Operation Protocol

- Never operate unattended.  
- Maintain a **minimum 5-foot safety zone** around the device perimeter.  
- Use **remote activation switch** whenever possible.  
- Do **not** touch or service while capacitors are charged.  
- Monitor system temperatures if active longer than 30 minutes.

## ✅ Emergency Shutdown Procedures

| Scenario              | Action                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Electrical Overload  | Hit E-Stop button or disconnect main power|
| RF Emission Concern  | Engage shielding panels fully, disconnect antennas|
| System Fire          | Use Class C fire extinguisher only     |
| Personnel Injury     | Call Emergency Services immediately    |

## ✅ Post-Operation Checklist

1. **Fully Discharge Capacitors**  
   - Use approved capacitor discharge stick  
   - Verify zero voltage using a rated multimeter

2. **Inspect for Damage**  
   - Check all wiring, terminals, and components  

3. **Log Activity**  
   - Record usage session, date/time, operator name  

---

## ✅ Regulatory Considerations

- FCC Part 15 Class A compliance (or regional equivalent) required.  
- Follow **NFPA 70 (NEC)** grounding and electrical safety codes.  
- For public-facing installations, additional certification may apply.

---

## ✅ Summary

Safety isn't optional. IX-ZeroCell systems are high-energy devices requiring disciplined operation practices.  
These protocols are minimum required standards.
