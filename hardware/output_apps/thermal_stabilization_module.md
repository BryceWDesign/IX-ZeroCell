# IX-ZeroCell – Thermal Stabilization Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Prevent thermal runaway and component failure by managing heat generated within IX-ZeroCell’s coil arrays, capacitor banks, and load balancing resistors.

## 💡 Why Thermal Stabilization?

- Magnetic pulse arrays generate eddy currents → heat buildup.  
- Capacitor dump resistors dissipate large transient currents → heat.  
- Thermal management improves longevity and safety.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### 1️⃣ Basic Fan-Control Setup

- Temperature sensors feed data to MCU.  
- MCU uses relay or MOSFET switch to power fans on/off based on pre-set thresholds.  
- Example:  
  - Fans ON @ 60°C  
  - Fans OFF @ 45°C  

---

### 2️⃣ Passive + Forced Air Hybrid

- Combine passive heatsinks with active airflow.  
- Heat sinks handle idle load heat; fans handle peak pulse events.  

---

### 3️⃣ Liquid Cooling System (Advanced Builds Only)

- Pump feeds coolant through copper pipe manifold wrapped around coil array/capacitor bank.  
- Radiator and fan system dissipates heat externally.  
- Use only if total system exceeds 5kW continuous dissipation.

## ✅ MCU Code Requirements

- Temperature sensor readouts every 100ms–1s depending on system size.  
- Fan control hysteresis: prevent rapid on/off cycles by setting separate ON/OFF thresholds.  
- Emergency shutdown trigger if temperature exceeds absolute limits.  

---

## ⚠️ Build Notes

- Use high-CFM industrial fans for larger builds (metal housing preferred).  
- Fans rated 12V or 24V recommended for integration with IX-ZeroCell’s standard output voltages.  
- Liquid cooling must be fully sealed: no leaks, dielectric coolant if possible.  

---

## ✅ Summary

- Thermal stabilization is mandatory in multi-module IX-ZeroCell systems.  
- Combines heat sinks, fans, optional liquid cooling, and microcontroller logic.  
- Increases system reliability and safety across all environmental conditions.
