# IX-ZeroCell ‚Äì Burst Discharge Trigger Module

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Safely release stored energy from supercapacitor bank in a high-current pulse triggered by logic or motion events

---

## ‚ö° Overview

This module allows a **controlled burst of electrical energy** to be discharged from IX-ZeroCell's supercap array.

Ideal for:

- Inductive kick (e.g., spark gap ignition)  
- Coil launchers / pulsed electromagnets  
- Quick motor startups  
- Instant flash charges  
- Voltage step cascades

| Component             | Notes                                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Supercap Bank          | 2.7V or 5.5V ultra or hybrid caps, 10‚Äì50F total  
| Gate Device            | SCR (e.g., 2N6509), IGBT (e.g., IRG4PC40), or Power MOSFET  
| Trigger Logic          | Motion trigger, MCU pin, or manual button  
| Flyback Diode          | 1N5408 / UF5408 for inductive loads  
| Shunt Resistor (opt.)  | Optional for current monitoring  
| Load (resistive/inductive)| Ignitor, motor coil, pulse bridge, etc.

## üßÆ Calculated Output

Assume:  
- 15F cap bank  
- Charged to 5.5V  
- Dumped into 0.1‚Ñ¶ load via SCR

**Discharge Energy (Joules):**

```
E = ¬Ω √ó C √ó V¬≤  
E = 0.5 √ó 15F √ó (5.5)¬≤ ‚âà 113.4 joules
```

This will be released in milliseconds ‚Äî powerful enough for high-voltage sparks, inrush motor kicks, or solenoid throws.

- SCR gate is pulsed by logic HIGH  
- Use opto-isolator if triggering from micro  
- Add small resistor (~100‚Ñ¶) in gate leg

## üîí Safety Tips

- Always limit pulse width unless your load is rated  
- Use heat sinks on SCR/IGBT  
- Never short cap bank directly  
- Add mechanical cutoff switch for testing  
- Place fast-blow fuse on cap bank output line
