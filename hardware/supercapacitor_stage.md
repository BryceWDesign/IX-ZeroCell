## ⚡ Why Supercapacitors?

Supercaps (ultracaps) are ideal for ambient energy systems:

- ✅ Near-infinite charge cycles  
- ✅ Instant energy uptake  
- ✅ Low ESR (can source bursts)  
- ✅ Wide operating temps  
- ✅ No thermal runaway, no battery regs

## 🛡️ Voltage Balancing Circuit

Since caps are in **series**, use a passive or active balance to prevent overvoltage on one cell.

### Option A: Passive Resistor Divider (Simple)

| Component | Value  | Notes                     |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------|
| R1, R2    | 1k–10k | Across each cap, equalize V  
| Bleed Cap | 100nF  | Optional smoothing  

Draws constant microamps — good for slow-charging systems.

### Option B: Active Balancer (Precise)

- Use LTC4041, CAP-XX balancers, or op-amp buffers  
- Needed if >5 caps used or large input surges expected

## 🧯 Safety & Isolation

| Feature             | Component     | Purpose                          |
|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Reverse Protection  | SS34 diode    | Prevents combiner back-feed  
| Voltage Tap Header  | 2-pin JST     | Debug/test access  
| Bleed Resistors     | 10k across caps| Prevents residual storage  
| Thermistor (opt.)   | NTC 10k       | Thermal monitoring

## 📦 Mounting / PCB Guidelines

- Place vertically to save board area  
- Leave at least 1.5mm clearance around cap bodies  
- Keep ground plane under caps for ESR minimization  
- Mount away from high-heat components (boost ICs)

## ⚙️ Real-World Example Cap Part Numbers

| Manufacturer | Part Number        | Specs              |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Nesscap      | ESHSR-0010C0-002R7 | 10F @ 2.7V, 50mΩ  
| Maxwell      | BCAP0010 P270 T04  | 10F @ 2.7V, 40mΩ  
| AVX          | SCCS10B275PRB      | 10F @ 2.7V

## ✅ Summary

- 2× 10F, 2.7V supercaps in series = 5F @ 5.4V  
- Low-ESR caps provide burst capacity for regulated outputs  
- Passive balance resistors prevent cell mismatch  
- Modular, safe, and chemically passive — no fire risk  
- Stores enough for short bursts of regulated 3.3V / 5V power
