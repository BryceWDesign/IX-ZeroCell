# IX-ZeroCell – USB-C Sink-Only Output Configuration

**Author:** Bryce Wooster  
**License:** Apache-2.0  
**Purpose:** Define how to wire USB-C in sink-only (power-out) mode with 5V output using passive CC pulldown resistors

---

## ⚠️ What This Is

IX-ZeroCell supports **powering** devices via USB-C.  
We are NOT accepting power.  
We are NOT negotiating USB PD (Power Delivery).  
We just offer **5V at VBUS** like a wall wart.

## 🔌 USB-C Sink-Only (Type-C) Wiring

| USB-C Pin  | Purpose         | Connect to         |
|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| VBUS       | 5V Output        | Boost VOUT  
| GND        | Ground           | System GND  
| CC1        | Pull-down (5.1kΩ)| To GND  
| CC2        | Pull-down (5.1kΩ)| To GND  
| D+ / D−    | Leave floating   | Not used  
| SBU1/2     | Leave floating   | Not used  

> Pull-down resistors signal to the device that this is a passive 5V source  
> No need for USB PD chip or controller

## 🧰 BOM

| Part            | Qty | Notes                               |
|------------------|-----|--------------------------------------|
| USB-C Connector  | 1   | Sink-only, 16P or 24P  
| Resistor 5.1kΩ   | 2   | 1% or better, for CC1/CC2  
| TVS Diode        | 1   | SMAJ6.5A or similar across VBUS  
| 10µF Ceramic Cap | 1   | Bypass near VBUS pin

## 🧪 Output Protection (Recap)

- Add **TVS diode** from VBUS to GND  
- Add **ferrite bead** between MT3608 and USB-C VBUS pin  
- Polyfuse optional but recommended (e.g. MF-R050)

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Do **not** connect to a host PC while powered — it will confuse host port  
- This config is for **powering** dev boards, not data  
- Safe for most ESP32-C3, Feather, and Arduino-type boards

---

## 🛠️ PCB Layout Tips

- Keep CC1/CC2 resistors close to USB-C connector  
- Trace VBUS from boost converter → ferrite bead → TVS → connector  
- Add ground pour under connector  
- Route GND pin with wide trace (1A+)  
- Use mechanical support pins if present

---

## ✅ Summary

- Offers 5V output via USB-C safely and passively  
- Standards-compliant sink-only config using 5.1kΩ pulldowns  
- No PD controller needed  
- Suitable for modern microcontroller boards, sensors, radios, etc.  
- Protect with TVS + optional fuse
